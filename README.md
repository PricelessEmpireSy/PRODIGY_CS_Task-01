# Caesar Cipher

## Description
This is my first project at PRODIGYINFOTECH Internship program, it is a simple Python program that implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm for encrypting and decrypting text. The Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption technique where each letter in the text is shifted by a certain number of places in the alphabet. This project allows users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

## Features
- Encrypts text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- Decrypts text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- Allows users to input custom messages and shift values.
- Input validation to ensure valid inputs.
- Error handling for unexpected inputs.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language used for the project.
- **VSCode**: The IDE used for writing and managing the project.
- **Git & GitHub**: For version control and sharing the project.

## Setup and Installation
1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

## Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
cd caesar_cipher
Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):

bash
python -m venv env
Activate the Virtual Environment:

## On Windows:

bash
.\env\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:

bash
source env/bin/activate
Install Required Packages (if any):

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
How to Use
Run the Program:

bash
python caesar_cipher.py
Enter the Message: When prompted, input the message you want to encrypt.

## Enter the Shift Value: Enter an integer value for the shift.

Example
plaintext
Enter the message: HELLO
Enter the shift value: 3
Encrypted message: KHOOR
Decrypted message: HELLO

## Learning Outcomes
Basic Python Programming: Understanding basic syntax and functions.

String Manipulation: Learning how to manipulate strings using ASCII values.

Encryption Techniques: Introduction to basic encryption and decryption concepts.

Version Control: Gaining experience with Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration.

Documentation: Recognizing the value of clear and detailed documentation.
