# Caesar Cipher

## Description
This in my first project at PRODIGYINFOTECH Internship program, it is a simple Python program that implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm for encrypting and decrypting text. The Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption technique where each letter in the text is shifted by a certain number of places in the alphabet. This project allows users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

## Features
- Encrypts text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- Decrypts text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- Allows users to input custom messages and shift values.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language used for the project.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
